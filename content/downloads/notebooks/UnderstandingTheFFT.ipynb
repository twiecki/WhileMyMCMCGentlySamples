      "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important algorithms in signal processing and data analysis. I've used it for years, but having no formal computer science background, It occurred to me this week that I've never thought to ask *how* the FFT computes the discrete Fourier transform so quickly.  I dusted off an old algorithms book and looked into it, and enjoyed reading about the deceptively simple computational trick that JW Cooley and John Tukey outlined in their classic [1965 paper](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1965-19-090/S0025-5718-1965-0178586-1/) introducing the subject."

Though it's still no match computationally speaking, readibility-wise the Python version is far superior to the FFTPACK source, which you can browse [here](http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/fft.c)."

      "So how does FFTPACK attain this last bit of speedup?  Well, mainly it's just a matter of detailed bookkeeping.  FFTPACK spends a lot of time making sure to reuse any sub-computation that can be reused.  Our numpy version still involves an excess of memory allocation and copying; in a low-level language like Fortran it's easier to control and minimize memory use.  In addition, the Cooley-Tukey algorithm can be extended to use splits of size other than 2 (what we've implemented here is known as the *radix-2* Cooley-Tukey FFT).  Also, other more sophisticated FFT algorithms may be used, including fundamentally distinct approaches based on convolutions (see, e.g. Bluestein's algorithm and Rader's algorithm).  The combination of the above extensions and techniques can lead to very fast FFTs even on arrays whose size is not a power of two."

      "Though the pure-Python functions are probably not useful in practice, I hope they've provided a bit of an intuition into what's going on in the background of FFT-based data analysis.  As data scientists, we can make-do with black-box implementations of fundamental tools constructed by our more algorithmically-minded colleagues, but I am a firm believer that the more understanding we have about the low-level algorithms we're applying to our data, the better practitioners we'll be."
