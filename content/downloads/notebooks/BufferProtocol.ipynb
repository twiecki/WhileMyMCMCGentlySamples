Using the buffer protocol, we can let multiple objects efficiently manipulate views of the same data buffers, without having to make copies of the often large datasets.\n",

The ability for Python to natively share data with these compiled libraries is incredibly important for scientific computing. This is one big reason that NumPy and its predecessors were initially developed, and it's why the buffer protocol was later proposed and added to Python's standard library. The buffer protocol is extremely useful for what scientists do with Python: build intuitive interfaces to compiled legacy code.\n",
      "\n",
      "With apologies to the [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) project's extremely active community, I should also mention that this is one of the main reasons that scientists don't really pay much attention to it: until PyPy can easily interface to all the C and Fortran code we use on a daily basis, all its JIT-ed performance gain is of very little use to us.\n",

      "Fortunately, most scientists can simply use the buffer protocol via tools like NumPy without knowing too much of the details of what's behind it. Because the buffer protocol is fundamentally a C-API entity, implementing new functionality with it generally requires digging into the guts of Python's C API. For example, the code that enables the above numpy example is found in NumPy's [buffer.c](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/core/src/multiarray/buffer.c) file, and reading through it is not particularly enlightening. This is the power of Python in a nutshell: it abstracts away C-level messiness like this and instead gives us the nice, powerful, and clean Python interface we all know and love.\n",
      "\n",
      "But sometimes you need to get your hands dirty. Imagine, for instance, that you have a C object that you'd like to wrap and make available to Python.  Your first course might be to use something like [f2py](http://wiki.scipy.org/Cookbook/F2Py), [cython](http://cython.org), or [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) to do this: I'd definitely recommend these tools for most problems of this nature.\n",

(For example, you may be interested in taking data structures from another language, such as Julia, and exposing them to Python in a flexible manner). Below I'll give you an example of how to do this."

Here we're using integers so we've used the ``\"i\"`` format code. The item formats are extremely flexible: you can basically use any of the codes within Python's [``struct``](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) module, which gives you nearly endless possibilities for passing around structured data. For more complicated arrays with multiple dimensions, you may have to allocate arrays for the shape, strides, etc. In that case, it's possible to define a ``release_buffer`` function which deallocates these arrays when the buffer is no longer needed.\n",
