And then I talk about how to get around this by using NumPy, SciPy, and related tools for vectorization of operations and calling into compiled code, and go on from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I realized something recently: despite the relative accuracy of the above statements, the words \"dynamically-typed-interpreted-buffers-vectorization-compiled\" probably mean very little to somebody attending an intro programming seminar. The jargon does little to enlighten people about what's actually going on \"under the hood\", so to speak.\n",

      "So I decided I would write this post, and dive into the details that I usually gloss over. Along the way, we'll take a look at using Python's standard library to introspect the goings-on of CPython itself. So whether you're a novice or experienced programmer, I hope you'll learn something from the following exploration."
